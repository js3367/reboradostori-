One very nice morning near the end of summer,
my mother woke me up at 4:00 A.M. and said, "Wake
up and smell the grass, sleepy head! Today is your
first day of school and you can't be late." I groaned in
my bed for twenty seconds, but eventually I got
dressed. I wore a blue and white striped, long sleeve
shirt (noun) with a collar on it, a red tie,
dark gray pants, white socks, black shoes, and a(n)
brown (adjective) hat. In ten minutes I made
lunch and ate my breakfast. 4:20(number)
minutes later, the bus came. A few minutes later, I
was at school.
In school, I met two really
sexual (adjective) kids. All of us became
friends very fast. That day we had Science, and
luckily my friends and I were at the same
dressing room (noun) .My friends' names are
bob(proper noun) and
kazooo kid (proper noun). In Math we weren't
together, and that really bugged me. We learned what
was (plural noun) were, and when to use
them. At snack and recess, we played a game
together. It was extremely fun. At P. E., we were
bouncing (-ing verb) off of the ropes onto 
fun bags (plural noun). I thought it was a very
good (adjective) idea. In swimming class,
we needed to swim extremely
fast (adverb), or else we would have to
swim longer.
Before I knew it, school was over. I grabbed all
my belongings and put them into my backpack. In two
minutes, the bus came. As I stepped into the bus I
shouted, "Goodbye, adios amigos, and shalom," to
my friends. Then I went into the bus. In a flash, I was
back home. This day was an extremely exciting day!
